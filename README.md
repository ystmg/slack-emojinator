Use by command `python upload.py emoji_name http://example.com/image.jpeg`

You need `convert` command by `imagemagick`.

*Bulk upload emoji into Slack*

Want to create a custom Slack emoji for every pokemon? Slack doesn't currently expose an API endpoint for creating emoji, probably to prevent users from doing exactly what I'm doing, but here's a way to do it anyway.

## Creating Emoji

You'll need Python and `pip` to get started. I recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and possibly [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as well. Standard best-practice Python stuff.

Prepare a directory that contains an image for each emoji you want to create. Remember to respect Slack's specifications for valid emoji images: no greater than 128px in width or height, no greater than 64K in image size. The base filename of each image file should be the name of the emoji (the bit you'll type inside `:` to display it).

Clone the project, create a new virtualenv, and install the prereqs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smashwilson/slack-emojinator.git
cd slack-emojinator
mkvirtualenv slack-emojinator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll need to provide your team name (the bit before ".slack.com" in your admin URL) and your session cookie (grab it from your browser). Copy `.env.example`, fill them in, and source it.

To grab your Slack session cookie:
* [Open your browser's dev tools](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337) and copy the value of `document.cookie`
* Go to the Network tab
* Re-load page like https://{teamname}.slack.com/customize/emoji
* Find call to `emoji` (it is most likely the very top request)
* Scroll to `Request-Headers` and copy the value of Cookie and add to .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
${EDITOR} .env
source .env
```

Now you're ready to go. Use a shell glob to invoke `upload.py` with the emoji files as ARGV:

```bash
python upload.py ${EMOJI_DIR}/*.png
```
